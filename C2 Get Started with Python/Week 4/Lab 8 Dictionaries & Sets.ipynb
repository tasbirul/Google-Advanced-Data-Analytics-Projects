    "In this lab, I have practiced creating, modifying, and working with data structures in Python. This has developed my knowledge of different kinds of data structures and the various operations that I can perform with them to answer questions about the data. It has also helped me prepare for projects I may encounter where I will need to use data structures to store and keep track of data.\n",
