# Get Started with Python

This is the second of seven courses in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate. The Python programming language is a powerful tool for data analysis. In this course, I have learned the basic concepts of Python programming and how data professionals use Python on the job. I have explored concepts such as object-oriented programming, variables, data types, functions, conditional statements, loops, and data structures.


## Lessons I have Learned

- Defined what a programming language is and why Python is used by data scientists.
- Created Python scripts to display data and perform operations.
- Controlled the flow of programs using conditions and functions.
- Utilized different types of loops when performing repeated operations.
- Identified data types such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
- Manipulated data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
- Imported and used Python libraries such as NumPy and pandas.
