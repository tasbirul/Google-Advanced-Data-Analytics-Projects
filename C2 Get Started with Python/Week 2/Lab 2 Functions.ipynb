    "## Conclusion\n",
    "- Python has allowed me to define and call functions that I create.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The main components of a function have been the definition statement, the body, and the output statement (usually `return` or `print`).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The function header has included the def keyword, followed by the name of the function, followed by parentheses, followed by a colon.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The function body has included an indented block of code that instructs the computer on what to do when the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The output statement has been what the function should produce as a result when executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functions have allowed me to reuse common code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - I have saved frequently used calculations to a function and reused them without writing out the equation multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functions have accepted single or multiple parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - I have customized functions to accept more than one parameter and perform calculations on them, which has allowed greater flexibility when working with fluctuating values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I have included functions such as `round()` in the return statement to help keep calculated values tidy and easy to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scaffolding functions with code comments has helped improve readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clearly commented code has explained how the code works as well as the intended results."
