    "\n",
    "For this activity, I have imagined myself as a data professional analyzing the users that log in to purchase tickets at a movie theater. I have saved the theater's unique identification code to a variable, studied the number of tickets sold, and the data types I'll be working with.\n",

    "In your work as an analyst, imagine you are considering sales at a specific theater and you want to save the theater's unique identification, which is `\"b79cn10k\"`, to a variable. By doing this, you'll be able to access the ID easily if you need it later. In the following code cell:\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are many useful operators in Python that helped me work with variables.\n",
    "  - The `=` assignment operator allowed me to assign or reassign a specific value to a variable.\n",
    "- The `print()` function in Python allowed me to display information.\n",
    "  - It can take in a value directly or a variable that stores a value.\n",
    "- The `type()` function in Python helped me to determine the data type of an object.\n",
    "  - If I pass in a variable to `type()`, it will output the data type of the value stored in the variable.\n",
    "- Python is able to convert some data types from one to another.\n",
    "    - Using the `int()` function on a variable that stores data as a **float** will convert the data from a floating point number to an integer."
